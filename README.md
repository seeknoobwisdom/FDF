# ðŸ“ˆ FdF â€“ Wireframe Map Renderer

`FDF` is a graphical 3D wireframe renderer built with **C** and **MiniLibX**, part of the **42 Abu Dhabi Core Curriculum**.  
It reads a 2D height map file and renders it as a 3D isometric or parallel projection with keyboard navigation and zoom.

## ðŸ§© About

`FDF` is a simple wireframe renderer that transforms **2D height maps** into **3D projections**.  
It teaches you how to:

- Read and parse map data
- Use **basic 3D math** (rotation, scaling, projection)
- Work with **MiniLibX** (a minimal graphical library provided by 42)
- Handle **keyboard inputs**, image buffers, and window rendering
